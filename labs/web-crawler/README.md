Lab - Depth-limiting Web Crawler
================================

Add depth-limiting to the concurrent web crawler from [crawl2.go](https://github.com/CodersSquad/hello-gophers/blob/master/src/crawl2.go).
That is, if the user sets `-depth=3`, then only URLs reachable by at most 3 links will be fetched.

- In order to make it easier to read, generate a log file with the found links. Please not print links on terminal. Your program should run as follows:

```
./web-crawler -depth=3 -results=results.txt https://google.com
```

- And, your `results.txt` file should look like:

```
http://google.com
http://www.google.com/intl/es-419/policies/terms/
https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo

General Requirements and Considerations
---------------------------------------
- Use the `web-crawler.go` file for your implementation.
- Don't forget to handle errors properly.
- Coding best practices implementation will be also considered.


Test Suite
----------
Build and Test automation is already implemented with the following command. Below some general tips and comments.

- Make sure that your program passes all test cases without errors.
- Remember that this is being executed by a robot script.
- You cannot edit the `lab.mk` file.
- Failed compilation or segmentation faults means 0-graded.
- Failed tests will be properly discounted from total grade.

```
make test
```
